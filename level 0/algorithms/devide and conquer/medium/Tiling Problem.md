# Tiling Problem
Given a “2 x n” board and tiles of size “2 x 1”, count the number of ways to tile the given board using the 2 x 1 tiles. A tile can either be placed horizontally i.e., as a 1 x 2 tile or vertically i.e., as 2 x 1 tile.

Examples:

    Input n = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    We need 3 tiles to tile the board of size  2 x 3. 
    We can tile the board using following ways
    1) Place all 3 tiles vertically. 
    2) Place first tile vertically and remaining 2 tiles horizontally.
    3) Place first 2 tiles horizontally and remaining tiles vertically
    
    Input n = 4
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    For a 2 x 4 board, there are 5 ways
    1) All 4 vertical
    2) All 4 horizontal
    3) First 2 vertical, remaining 2 horizontal
    4) First 2 horizontal, remaining 2 vertical
    5) Corner 2 vertical, middle 2 horizontal
