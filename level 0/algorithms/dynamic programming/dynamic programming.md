## Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming is also used in optimization problems. Like divide-and-conquer method, Dynamic Programming solves problems by combining the solutions of subproblems.

 **Moreover, Dynamic Programming algorithm solves each sub-problem just once and then saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the work of re-computing the answer every time.**

Two main properties of a problem suggest that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming. These properties are  

 - **overlapping sub-problems**
 - **optimal substructure**.
