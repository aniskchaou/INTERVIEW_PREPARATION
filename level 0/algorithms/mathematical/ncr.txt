Program to calculate value of nCr
Following are common definition of Binomial Coefficients.

A binomial coefficient C(n, k) can be defined as the coefficient of X^k in the expansion of (1 + X)^n.
A binomial coefficient C(n, k) also gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that k objects can be chosen from among n objects; more formally, the number of k-element subsets (or k-combinations) of an n-element set.
Given two numbers n and r, find value of nCr

Examples :




Input :  n = 5, r = 2
Output : 30
The value of 5C2 is 10

Input : n = 3, r = 1
Output : 3
Recommended: Please try your approach on {IDE} first, before moving on to the solution.
The idea is simply based on below formula.

nCr = (n!) / (r! * (n-r)!)
