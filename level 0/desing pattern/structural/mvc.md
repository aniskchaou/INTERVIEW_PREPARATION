Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern commonly **used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.**

**Model**
The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. **It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.**

**View**
**Any representation of information** such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

**Controller**
**Accepts input and converts it to commands** for the model or view.
