## SDLC

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) **is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares.** 

The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

-   SDLC is the acronym of Software Development Life Cycle.
    
-   It is also called as Software Development Process.
    
-   SDLC is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process.
    

    
The life cycle defines **a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.**

A typical Software Development Life Cycle consists of the following stages −

### Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis

Requirement analysis is the most important and fundamental stage in SDLC. 


### Stage 2: Defining Requirements

Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and **document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts.** 


This is done through an  **SRS (Software Requirement Specification)**  document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.

### Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture

Based on the requirements specified in SRS, usually more than one design approach for the product architecture is proposed and documented in a DDS - Design Document Specification.

This DDS is reviewed by all the important stakeholders and based on various parameters as risk assessment, product robustness, design modularity, budget and time constraints, the best design approach is selected for the product.

 The internal design of all the modules of the proposed architecture should be clearly defined with the minutest of the details in DDS.

### Stage 4: Building or Developing the Product

In this stage of SDLC the actual development starts and the product is built. 

Developers must follow the coding guidelines defined by their organization and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to generate the code. Different high level programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, Java and PHP are used for coding. The programming language is chosen with respect to the type of software being developed.

### Stage 5: Testing the Product

This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC. 

### Stage 6: Deployment in the Market and Maintenance

Once the product is tested and ready to be deployed it is released formally in the appropriate market. 

After the product is released in the market, its maintenance is done for the existing customer base.

## SDLC Models

There are various software development life cycle models defined and designed which are followed during the software development process. These models are also referred as Software Development Process Models". 

Following are the most important and popular SDLC models followed in the industry −

-   Waterfall Model
-   Iterative Model
-   Spiral Model
-   V-Model
-   Big Bang Model

Other related methodologies are Agile Model, RAD Model, Rapid Application Development and Prototyping Models.
