### ******1. What is Kubernetes?******

****Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that is used for automating the tasks of managing, monitoring, scaling, and deploying containerized applications. It creates groups of containers that can be logically discovered and managed for easy operations on containers.****

### ******2. What are the benefits of Kubernetes?******

****With the container orchestration tool Kubernetes, it becomes extremely easy to handle containers. We can respond to customer demands by deploying the applications faster and in a more predictable manner.****

****Here, we will list some of the benefits of Kubernetes:****

****• Automatic scheduling  
• Automated rollback  
• Horizontal scaling  
• Auto-healing capabilities****

### ******3. What is the difference between Kubernetes and Docker Swarm?******

****Docker Swarm is a default container orchestration tool that comes with Docker. Docker Swarm can only orchestrate simple Docker containers. Kubernetes, on the other hand, helps manage much more complex software application containers. Kubernetes offers support for larger demand production environment.****

### ******4. What is orchestration in software?******

****Application orchestration in the software process means that we can integrate two or more applications. We will be able to automate arrangement, coordination, and management of computer software. The goal of any orchestration process is to streamline and optimize frequent repeatable processes.****



### ******5. What is a Kubernetes namespace?******

****The Kubernetes namespace is used in the environment wherein we have multiple users spread in the geographically vast areas and working on multiple projects. What the namespace does is dividing the cluster resources between multiple users.****


### ******6. What is a pod in Kubernetes?******

****We can think of Kubernetes pod as a group of containers that are run on the same host. So, if we regularly deploy single containers, then our container and the pod will be one and the same.****

### ******7. What is a node in Kubernetes?******

****A node in Kubernetes is a worker machine which is also known as a minion. This node could be a physical machine or a virtual machine. For each node, there is a service to run pods, and it is managed by master components. The node services could include kubelet, kube-proxy, and so on.****
