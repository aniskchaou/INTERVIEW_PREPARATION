## 2) What is JUnit?

JUnit is the testing framework, it is used for unit testing of Java code.

1.  JUnit = Java + Unit Testing


## 3) What is unit testing?

The process of testing individual functionality (known as a unit) of the application is called unit testing.


## 4) What is the difference between manual testing and automated testing?

Manual testing is performed by Human, so it is time-consuming and costly. Automated testing is performed by testing tools or programs, so it is fast and less costly.

## 5) Give some disadvantages of manual testing.

Following are some disadvantages of manual testing:

-   The testing is very time consuming and is very tiring.
-   The testing demands a very big investment in the human resources.
-   The testing is less reliable
-   The testing cannot be programmed.

----------


## 7) Is it necessary to write the test case for every logic?

No, we should write the test case only for that logic that can be reasonably broken.

----------

## 8) What are the useful JUnit extensions?

-   JWebUnit
-   XMLUnit
-   Cactus
-   MockObject

----------

## 9) What are the features of JUnit?

-   Opensource
-   Annotation support for test cases
-   Assertion support for checking the expected result
-   Test runner support to execute the test case

## 10) How is the testing of the 'protected' method done?

To test the protected method, the test class is declared in the same package as the target class.

----------


## 12) If the JUnit method's return type is 'string', what will happen?

JUnit test methods are designed to return 'void'. So the execution will fail.

----------

## 13) Is the use of 'main' method possible for unit testing?

Yes

----------

## 14) Is it necessary to write the test class to test every class?

No



## 18) What is the Unit Test Case?

A Unit Test Case is the combination of **input data and expected output result.** It is defined to test the functionality of a unit.

----------

## 19) What is the use of @Test annotation?

The @Test annotation is used to mark the method as the test method.

----------

## 20) What is the test suit?

The test suit allows us to group multiple test cases so that it can be run together. TestSuit is the container class under junit.framework.TestSuite package.


## 22) What are the important JUnit annotations?

The test runner is used to execute the test cases.

-   @Test
-   @BeforeClass
-   @Before
-   @After
-   @AfterClass


## 23) What does Assert class?

Assert class provides methods to test the test cases.
